# Rules

1. You must provide credit via a link to my profile (/lowkeywicked). Templates come with credit already in them, you're free to move this around as long as it remains clearly visible somewhere on the page.
2. If you use one of my freebies, please post here: https://toyhou.se/~forums/16.htmlcss-graphics/30101.free-profile-templates
3. You are allowed to edit this template in any way you wish; change it as much as you like **as long as credit remains**. You may fuse my templates together. You may fuse my freebie templates with other templates as long as I am still credited along with the other template creator(s).
4. Do not PM me with editing questions about freebies. I will not reply.
5. Do not redistribute this coding. If someone is interested in using it, please refer them to my account to get it from the original source.
6. Remove my personal images before posting publicly. Use a staging character to edit templates if you do not have time to immediately remove my images.

# Notes
* Make sure WYSIWYG is turned **off**. Do not use the source code button, turn it off
* It is highly recommended you back up your profiles on your own device
* I recommend notepad ++ for editing your profiles
